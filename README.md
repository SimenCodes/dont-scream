# Don't Scream – Limit Spotify Ad Volume
If you’re anything like me, you hate being interrupted by artists like Christina Grimmie suddenly screaming “LOVE ME LIKE YOU DO” into your ears when listening to calm, classical music on Spotify. Don’t Scream is a very simple app I made to fix this little annoyance. It will listen for Spotify’s metadata broadcasts, and lower the volume slightly during advertisements. It doesn’t mute or skip ads, it only requests a duckable, transistent audio focus until Spotify is finished playing the ad.

The app is free, but if you like it, please consider making a small [donation](http://simen.codes/donate/).

## Usage
The setup is really simple. Just download and install the app on your phone. If it doesn’t work out of the box, double-check that “Device Broadcast” is enabled in the Spotify settings.

Please note that I consider this app a small experiment – I wrote it because I had half an hour to kill before the bus arrived. Still, if you have any questions, feel free to ask.
